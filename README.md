# Phonebook

This application is an exercise for Full Stack Open offered through the University of Helsinki.

Exercise 3.22 instructs to install ESLint, but since I had already been using Prettier, I changed Prettier's configuration to match the style in Full Stack Open's example code instead.

The deployed version can be found at https://voxantiqua-phonebook.fly.dev
